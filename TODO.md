- Pick better fonts and normalize fonts (only two fonts)
- Let the user keep giving the tree money even after they've already given money
- CSS for gravatar in logged-in navbar
- Better explain how endowments link to charities. "Donate to an endowment" instead of "Donate to giv2giv" on landing page Step 1 (Change this in two places, (1) the animation and (2) the longer, "How it works" section)
