# IMPORTANT STUFF #

- When you create a new endowment, you should automatically subscribe to it (Make crossroads redirect you immediately to the endowment you just created, also show a growl message prompting the user to subscribe to it.)
- Navbar search loading spinner, also expand to fill width
share this endowment via fb/twitter
- Pagination in endowments

endpoints for fb/goog:
/auth/facebook
/auth/google_oauth2


# OTHER STUFF #

- Add FB / Twitter Links on the landing page
- Pick better fonts and normalize fonts (only two fonts)
- CSS for gravatar in logged-in navbar
- Search for CHARITIES upon login, not ENDOWMENTS. Make endowments optional, and call them "TEAMS" instead

- New feed for charities
- Endowment slug (in URL) should be its name and not its number
- Remove projected graph from endowment_details.html ?

More details in projected tooltip (date, total_donations, total_grants, total_fees, balance)
Pending grants on #numbers

Endowment details:
show active subscription amount (e.g. $30/month)

I put pending grants on #numbers; would be cool to have it on endowment_details too.
