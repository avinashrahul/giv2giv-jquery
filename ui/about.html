                giv2giv uses a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) as its underlying charitable giving and investment vehicle. DAFs were originally approved by the IRS in the 1930s and are now the fastest growing charitable giving vehicle in the United States of America, with <a href="http://www.nptrust.org/daf-report/recent-growth.html" target=_blank>more than 200,000 donor-advised accounts established holding over $45 billion in assets</a>.

                DAFs allow donors to maintain advisory rights to their donations, so you tell giv2giv where your donations should go through your donor "advice" (the 'A' in Donor Advised Fund). At giv2giv you specify this advice by creating or funding an endowment that grants to your favorite charities.

                By law DAFs must be sponsored by a nonprofit organization. The giv2giv DAF sponsor is giv2giv, Inc. a Virginia nonprofit incorporated in June 2012.

		    <p>The giv2giv platform tracks and manages your endowment within our DAF.  DAF assets are invested in the <a href="http://www.paxworld.com/advisors/investment-strategies/pax-world-mutual-funds/balanced-fund" target=_blank>Pax World Balanced Fund</a>, which has been selected as giv2givâ€™s investment vehicle of choice due to its balanced portfolio and use of Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) standards. SRI investments are based on financial metrics, sustainability, demonstrated excellence in corporate governance, and environmental impact, <strong>allowing your donations to do good while they are waiting to do more good</strong>. All investment gains and losses are tracked at the individual donor level. Our methodology is 100&#37; transparent -- check out our <a href="https://github.com/giv2giv/giv2giv-rails" target=_blank>open-source code</a>!

                    <p>giv2giv makes periodic grants <em>out</em> to donors' favorite causes, currently 1.25&#37; of the entire DAF every 90 days for a total annual grant of 5&#37; per year. By law, giv2giv will take under advisement the charities selected by you, the donors, and we will follow this advice whenever possible. Sorry, giv2giv cannot follow your advice if you specify grants should go to your Uncle Leo - only registered charities!</p>
                    <p>Now comes the fun part! We send anonymous, unrestricted grants out to charities so they can direct resources where they are most needed.</p>

                  <p>Yes, there are fees - aren't there always? </p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>giv2giv keeps the lights on with a 0.125&#37;/quarter fee on the balance of the DAF. On an annual basis this is &frac12;&#37; which we feel is a great deal for the services provided. In fact, we think this is as low or lower than any DAF or private foundatino out there.</li>
                  <li>The credit card processor (stripe.com) charges a fee to send money from your credit card to giv2giv - this is currently $0.30 plus 2.9&#37; per donation. This fee is deducted from your donation prior to being added to your balance in the DAF.</li>
                  <li>The grant processor (dwolla.com) charges a fee to send grant money from giv2giv to charities - Grants are free for any grant under $10, and $0.25 for anything over. This fee is deducted from the grant at the time it is sent to the charity.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Got an idea to help us lower our fees? <a href="https://github.com/giv2giv" target=_blank>giv2giv is open-source</a> so you can fork our code and add in another low-cost payment processor. Join us. Let's work together.</p>
