          <p>giv2giv makes it easy to set-up an account.  All we ask for is your name, e-mail address, and a password for your account.  Once you've provided this info, you'll be able to browse endowments or create your own.  You can explore our eligible charities by clicking on the button to create your own endowment and using the search box at the bottom of the pop-up window.</p>

          <p>When you're ready to subscribe to an endowment, there is one additional step required - adding a credit card to your account.  Navigate to the "Donor" tab and then click on "Payment Accounts."  From there select "Add Payment Account" and fill out your info.  <strong>Don't worry, giv2giv never shares your information with any other person or organization.</strong></p>

          <p>giv2giv is trying to revolutionize personal philanthropy and recurring monthly subscriptions are key to building meaningful endowments for the charities that we all care about.  Recurring contributions to the endowments grow the balance above and beyond the investment earnings and mean that <strong>your charities get a larger payout every quarter - cool, right?</strong>  giv2giv has set up its subscriptions with no end-date.  This allows us to separate charitable giving decisions from end of year tax decisions. That said, we understand that things happen and you may need to cancel your subscription.  After you subscribe to an endowment, you'll see our green "Subscribe" button turn into a red "Unsubscribe" button.  Click that button (and another button to confirm) and you are unsubscribed with no additional payments or fees.</p>

          <p><strong>giv2giv uses a Donor Advised Fund</strong> (DAF) as its underlying charitable giving and investment vehicle. DAFs were originally approved by the IRS in the 1930s and are now the fastest growing charitable giving vehicle in the United States of America, with <a href="http://www.nptrust.org/daf-report/recent-growth.html" target=_blank>more than 200,000 donor-advised accounts established holding over $45 billion in assets</a>.</p>
          <p>Donor Advised Funds allow donors to maintain advisory rights to their donations, so you tell giv2giv where your donations should go through your donor "advice" (the 'A' in Donor Advised Fund). At giv2giv you specify this advice by creating or funding an endowment that grants to your favorite charities.</p>
          <p>By law DAFs must be sponsored by a nonprofit organization. The giv2giv Donor Advised Fund sponsor is giv2giv, Inc. a Virginia nonprofit incorporated in June 2012.</p>

SRI investments are based on financial metrics, sustainability, demonstrated excellence in corporate governance, and environmental impact, <strong>allowing your donations to do good while they are waiting to do more good</strong>. All investment gains and losses are tracked at the individual donor level.

          <p>giv2giv makes periodic grants <em>out</em> to donors' favorite causes, currently <strong>1.25&#37; of the entire fund every 90 days</strong> for a total annual grant of 5&#37; per year. By law, giv2giv will take under advisement the charities selected by you, the donors, and we will follow this advice whenever possible. Sorry, giv2giv cannot follow your advice if you specify grants should go to your Uncle Leo - only registered charities!</p>
          <p>Now comes the fun part! We send anonymous, unrestricted grants out to charities so they can direct resources where they are most needed.</p>

          <p>Yes, there are fees - aren't there always? </p>
            <ul>
              <li>giv2giv keeps the lights on with a 0.125&#37;/quarter fee on the balance of the fund. On an annual basis this is &frac12;&#37; which we feel is a great deal for the services provided. In fact, we think this is as low or lower than any Donor Advised Fund or private foundation out there.</li>
              <li>The credit card processor (stripe.com) charges a fee to send money from your credit card to giv2giv - this is currently $0.30 plus 2.9&#37; per donation. This fee is deducted from your donation prior to being added to your balance in the giv2giv fund.</li>
              <li>The grant processor (dwolla.com) charges a fee to send grant money from giv2giv to charities - Grants are free for any grant under $10, and $0.25 for anything over. This fee is deducted from the grant at the time it is sent to the charity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Got an idea to help us lower our fees? <a href="https://github.com/giv2giv" target=_blank>giv2giv is open-source</a> so you can fork our code and add in another low-cost payment processor. Join us. Let's work together.</p>
