                giv2giv uses a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) as its underlying vehicle. DAFs were originally approved by the IRS in the 1920s, and have recently become the fastest-growing vehicle due to the DAF's flexible nature. 

                DAFs allow donors to maintain advisory rights to their donations, so you get a say in where your donations go through your donor "advice" (the 'A' in Donor Advised Fund). Donors specify this advice by creating or funding an endowment that pays out to specific charities.

                By law DAFs must be sponsored by a nonprofit organization. Our DAF sponsor is giv2giv, Inc. a nonprofit formed in the state of Virginia in June 2012.

                    <p>You make a donation to giv2giv. Your donation is tax-deductible - for most folks just as much as a donation to any other public charity. We're supposed to say: Please check with your tax consultant for details on your specific tax situation.</p>

                    <p>giv2giv keeps track of your donations separately from everyone else's. We then invest the donations in top-tier Socially Responsible Investments (SRIs). The current SRI giv2giv uses is <a href="http://www.paxworld.com/advisors/investment-strategies/pax-world-mutual-funds/balanced-fund" target=_blank>Pax World Balanced Fund</a>. In the future giv2giv would like to provide additional SRIs so savvy investors have more choice. All investment gains and losses are tracked per-donor. Want to know exactly how? We're open-source, so you can <a href="https://github.com/giv2giv/giv2giv-rails" target=_blank>examine at our source code</a>!

                    <p>giv2giv makes periodic grants out to donors' favorite causes, usually every 90 days. By law giv2giv will take under advisement the charities selected by you, the donors. This is the fun(d?) part! We send anonymous, unrestricted grants, so charities can direct these funds where they are most needed.</p>

                  <p>Yes, there are fees - aren't there always? </p>
                  <ul>
                  <li>giv2giv keeps the lights on with a 0.125%/quarter fee on the DAF fund. This is much cheaper than managing your investments with the major institutions. <strong>The total amount we use to keep the service free for the non-profits we support is less than &frac12;%</strong>. </li>
                  <li>The credit card processor (currently stripe.com) charges a fee to send money from your credit card to giv2giv - This is currently $0.30 plus 2.9% per donation. Ouch!</li>
                  <li>The grant processor (currently dwolla.com) charges a fee to send money from giv2giv to our favorite charities - This is currently free for any grant under $10, and $0.25 for anything over.</li>
                  </ul>
