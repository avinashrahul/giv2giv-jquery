                giv2giv uses a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) as its underlying charitable giving and investment vehicle. DAFs were originally approved by the IRS in the 1930s and are now the fastest growing charitable giving vehicle in the United States of America, with <a href="http://www.nptrust.org/daf-report/recent-growth.html" target=_blank>more than 200,000 donor-advised accounts established holding over $45 billion in assets</a>.

                DAFs allow donors to maintain advisory rights to their donations, so you tell giv2giv where your donations should go through your donor "advice" (the 'A' in Donor Advised Fund). At giv2giv you specify this advice by creating or funding an endowment that grants to your favorite charities.

                By law DAFs must be sponsored by a nonprofit organization. The giv2giv DAF sponsor is giv2giv, Inc. a Virginia nonprofit incorporated in June 2012.

                    <p>giv2giv keeps track of your donations separately from everyone else's. We then invest the donations in top-tier Socially Responsible Investments (SRIs). We select investment funds based on financial metrics, sustainability and demonstrated excellence in corporate governance, environmental impact, <strong>allowing your donations to do good while they are waiting to do more good.</strong> The SRI giv2giv uses is <a href="http://www.paxworld.com/advisors/investment-strategies/pax-world-mutual-funds/balanced-fund" target=_blank>Pax World Balanced Fund</a>. All investment gains and losses are tracked per-donor. Our methodology is 100&#37; transparent - check out our <a href="https://github.com/giv2giv/giv2giv-rails" target=_blank>open-source code</a>!

                    <p>giv2giv makes periodic grants <em>out</em> to donors' favorite causes, usually 1.25&#37; of the entire DAF every 90 days to achieve 5&#37; per year. By law giv2giv will take under advisement the charities selected by you, the donors, and we will follow this advice whenever possible. Sorry, giv2giv cannot follow your advice if you specify grants should go to your Uncle Leo - only registered charities!</p>
                    <p>Now comes the fun part! We send anonymous, unrestricted grants out to charities so they can direct resources where they are most needed.</p>

                  <li>giv2giv keeps the lights on with a 0.125&#37;/quarter fee on the DAF fund. This is much cheaper than the up to 5&#37; annual fee you would pay managing your charitable funds at a major institution. <strong>The total amount we use to keep the service free for the non-profits we support is less than &frac12;&#37;</strong>. </li>
                  <li>The credit card processor (stripe.com) charges a fee to send money from your credit card to giv2giv - this is currently $0.30 plus 2.9&#37; per donation.</li>
                  <li>The grant processor (dwolla.com) charges a fee to send grant money from giv2giv to charities - Grants are free for any grant under $10, and $0.25 for anything over.</li>
